1.part1-Dataset:
Real_dataset can be accessed by 'http://murphylab.cbd.cmu.edu/software/2010_PNAS_Unmixing/'.
The samples of synthetic dataset are shown in .\Synthetic_dataset\data, and the synthetic processing is in .\Synthetic_dataset\code.
2.part2-Bestfitting:
The deep learning model, Bestfitting, can be obtained by ¡®https://github.com/CellProfiling/HPA-competition-solutions/tree/master/bestfitting¡¯.
3.part3-Unmixing_methods:
Before running, replace '.\functions\RNNMF' in .\functions\do_RNNMF.mat with full path of 'RNNMF'.
Run MasterSamples.m.
